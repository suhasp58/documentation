    1. Install redis server in linux box.
   
       Run the commands in the CLI to install and setup redis.
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get upgrade
	   sudo apt-get install redis-server
	   systemctl start redis-server.service
	    sed -i 's/bind 127.0.0.1 ::1/bind 0.0.0.0/g' /etc/redis/redis.conf
	    systemctl stop redis-server.service
	    systemctl start redis-server.service
	   now type " redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379" or " redis-cli" to start redis 
	   you can see redis get started in the cli 
	   Once this step is completed go to step 2 i.e., getting code from git and building it.
	
	
	2. Get the code from the github repository for data-pusher application to send data into redis.
	   Type " git clone https://github.com/suhasp58/data-pusher.git " in the CLI to get the data-pusher code.
	   Type " git clone https://github.com/suhasp58/File.git " in the CLI to get the FILE repository.
	   clone both the repositories in the same directory.
	   
	   a.Goto to cloned repository data-pusher and Build the code obtained from git hub using the command mentioned below.
	   Now run 
	   "mvn clean install" to build project.
	   
	   After successful installation we can see jar file generated in target folder.
	   Run 
	   "java -jar -Dserver.port=8081 target/springredis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 8081 5000 /File/File1.txt " to start data-pusher for process-1 running on port 8081 with refresh time of 5 seconds.
	   "java -jar -Dserver.port=8082 target/springredis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 8082 5000 /File/File2.txt " to start data-pusher for process-2 running on port 8082  with refresh time of 5 seconds.
	   "java -jar -Dserver.port=8083 target/springredis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 8083 5000 /File/File3.txt " to start data-pusher for process-3 running on port 8083  with refresh time of 5 seconds.
	   "java -jar -Dserver.port=8084 target/springredis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 8084 5000 /File/File4.txt " to start data-pusher for process-4 running on port 8084  with refresh time of 5 seconds.

	   Note: -Dserver.port overwrites the default port associated with the spring boot.
	     
	3. Get the code from the github repository for spring client application to get data from redis.
	   Type " git clone https://github.com/suhasp58/data-retriever.git " in the CLI to get the server code.
	   Goto to cloned repository Build the code obtained from git hub.
	   #note: The ip address of redis is set to localhost and can be changed as per the host machine in application.properties file.
       Now run "mvn clean install" to build project.
	   After successful installation we can see jar file generated in target folder.
	   Run "java -jar -Dserver.port=8089 target/RedisClient-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar " to start spring app on port 8089.
	   
	   type:
	         curl \
                 --header "Content-type: application/json" \
                 --request POST \
                 --data '{
                 "server":"10.37.56.1",
                  "port":8085
                  }' \
                  http://localhost:8089/server/getData
	   
	   
	  Note : The server and port numbers can be verified as per the requirements.

     Dockerizing the Project:
	 
	 step 1:
	 
	 Go to / directory and then clone the below mentioned repositiory uisng the following command
	 
	 " git clone https://github.com/suhasp58/build_sc.git "
	 
	 Now go to your cloned repositiory and you can fine build.sh named shell script.
	 Open the build.sh file using " vi build.sh " 
	 Remove the '#' at the beginning for both lines 4 and 5.
	 Now go to line 5 and replace "<yourip>" with ip address of your local machine within double quotes ("").
	 Now save the file using ESCAPE followed by :wq  .
	 #This will change the ip address to your address in the source file.
	 Now run the script using "bash build.sh"
	 
	 Upon successful completion you can find the docker containers up by checking out using " docker ps "
	 
     step 2:
	 
	  now clone " git clone https://github.com/suhasp58/data-retriever.git " 
	  #note: The ip address of redis is set to localhost and can be changed as per the host machine in application.properties file.
       Now run "mvn clean install" to build project.
	   After successful installation we can see jar file generated in target folder.
	   Run "java -jar -Dserver.port=8089 target/RedisClient-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar " to start spring app on port 8089.
	   
	   type:
	         curl \
                 --header "Content-type: application/json" \
                 --request POST \
                 --data '{
                 "server":"10.37.56.1",
                  "port":8085
                  }' \
                  http://localhost:8089/server/getData
				  
				  
				  #In the local host you can give your ip.
	   
	   
	  Note : The server and port numbers can be verified as per the requirements.
